# Caroline-Poole-Productions-Website
I created a website for a local company in Norwich, where I used HTML5 to display the information, CSS4 to layout the information in the HTML5 pages correctly, JavaScript to display my digital Clock, PHP (post method) to gather and then send the contact details from the Contact Page to the owner of the website ie: Caroline Poole Productions.
